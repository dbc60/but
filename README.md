## Basic Unit Test
Basic Unit Test (BUT) is a simple unit-test driver. The idea is collect related unit tests into a test suite that is compiled and linked into a shared library (DLL, .so, whatever). The test driver is a just a command-line tool that accepts paths to shared libraries. It will load them and run the tests within.

It currently builds only on Windows with Visual Studio 2017, 2019, or 2020. It will probably build and run on other operating systems with other C compilers, I just haven't included build scripts/tools for those, yet.
